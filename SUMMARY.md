# Supabase Integration - Technical Summary

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. User Profile Display Problems
- Fixed 406 (Not Acceptable) error when querying profiles by:
  - Adding proper headers to Supabase client
  - Changing query format from `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()`
  - Improving error handling for profile queries

### 2. Database Schema Issues
- Addressed missing `author_name` column in posts table:
  - Created SQL script to add this column if missing
  - Added code to handle cases where column not yet available

### 3. Comprehensive Profile Data Solution
- Created `userProfileService.js` with profile data caching
- Modified service to query profiles directly from Supabase profiles table
- Updated all related services to use the new centralized service
- Implemented proper permission checks for post creation (admin-only)

## Result
The application now properly displays user profiles (usernames and avatars) for all users system-wide, not just the logged-in user. Permission controls ensure only administrators can create posts.
